# ft_printf (2019 version)

The goal of this [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) project is to implement our own `printf` in C. 
We needed to use a `va_list` to handle any number of arguments. We also had to code our very first parser in order to catch meaningful characters sequence used for formatting the output.

## ðŸ§­ Usage

Clone the repository and access it with `cd`. From there, use the following command :
```
make
```
